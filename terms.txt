Option 2: Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ______ days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. 

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] 

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. 

The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name of state]. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. 

Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions. 

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than _____ years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.


Option 3: Binding Arbitration
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute" and collectively, “Disputes”), any Dispute brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. 

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. 

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] 

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. 

Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name of state]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of, personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. 

Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site or Services be commenced more than ______ years after the cause of action arose. 

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Option 2/Option 3: Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Option 2/Option 3: Exceptions to [Informal Negotiations and] Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning [informal negotiations and] binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. 

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

This website uses Google services. Therefore, you also agree to the Google terms and conditions, as follows:

GOOGLE T ERMS OF SERVICE
Effective March 31, 2020
Archived versions
What’s covered in these terms
We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s
important to establish what you can expect from us as you use
Google services, and what we expect from you.
These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company,
and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define
Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the
following topic headings:
What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you
find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to
expect in case someone violates these terms
Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.
Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we
encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your
information.
Service provider
Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:
Google LLC
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, California 94043
USA
Age requirements
If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or
legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read
these terms with you.
If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms
apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific
additional terms and policies.
Your relationship with Google
These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you
permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s
business works and how we earn money. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean
Google LLC and its affiliates.
What you can expect from us
Provide a broad range of useful services
We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
platforms (like Google Play)
integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
devices (like Google Home)
Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the
next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google
Calendar.
Improve Google services
We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we
invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and
to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual
improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits
to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.
We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we
carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact
on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve
performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical
developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to
offer.
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a
service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content
from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing
abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.
What we expect from you
Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms
The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities
in:
these terms
service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age
requirements
We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common
questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy
Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.
Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we
have in the services.
Respect others
Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment
for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for
example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services
Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate
conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these
rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a
fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.
Permission to use your content
Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your
content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the
content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you
have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.
License
Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that
you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative
content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone
else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.
We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.
You provide Google with that permission through this license.
What’s covered
This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.
What’s not covered
This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual
property rights
This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the
address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s
considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is
covered in the Service-related communications section below.
Scope
This license is:
worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
Rights
This license allows Google to:
host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save
your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to
others
modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
sublicense these rights to:
other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share
photos with people you choose
our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these
terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below
Purpose
This license is for the limited purpose of:
operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as
designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated
systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
for spam, malware, and illegal content
to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album
in Google Photos to keep related photos together
to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and
personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off
in Ads Settings)
This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote
a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might
show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms
Duration
This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.
If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems
will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two
exceptions:
If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you
shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that
photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it
from your Google Account.
If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that
search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as
part of their search results.
Using Google services
Your Google Account
If you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some
services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you
need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.
You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to
keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.
Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
Many organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services.
To use our services on behalf of an organization:
an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might
require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.
If you’re based in the United Kingdom, then these terms don’t affect the rights you may have as a
business user of online intermediation services — including online platforms such as Google Play —
under the EU Platform-to-Business Regulation.
Service-related communications
To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other
information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.
If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your
feedback without obligation to you.
Content in Google services
Your content
Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example,
you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that
you created.
See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and
how your content is used in our services
See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated
content from our services
If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the
infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google
Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.
Google content
Some of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual
illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and
any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in
our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to
use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.
Other content
Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or
organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper
article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s
permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’
content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.
Software in Google services
Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software
as part of the services.
The license we give you is:
worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else
Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make
available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override
parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may
not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written
permission or applicable law lets you do so.
When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates
automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust
your automatic update settings.
In case of problems or disagreements
By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go
wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a consumer,
then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.
Warranty
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in
this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.
Disclaimers
The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the
specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1)
described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided
under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.
Liabilities
For all users
These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms
don’t limit Google’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct.
Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or
disagreements), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our
breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.
For business users and organizations only
If you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:
You’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any thirdparty legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to
your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional
terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
indirect or consequential loss
punitive damages
Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) £500
or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the
breach
If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those
responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain
immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
Taking action in case of problems
Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably
possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we
reasonably believe that doing so would:
cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
compromise an investigation
compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services
Removing your content
If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific
additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or
Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with
applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or
harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.
Suspending or terminating your access to Google services
Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google
Account if any of these things happen:
you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies
we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
— for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping
content that doesn’t belong to you
If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.
Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service,
we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.
Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.
If you’re a resident of, or an organization based in, the United Kingdom, these terms and your
relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by
English law, and you can file legal disputes in the English courts.
About these terms
By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These
terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for
other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.
We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But
not all services mentioned may be available in your country.
If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right
away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the
future.
We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our
services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies,
pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent
abuse or harm.
If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with
reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a

Digital Safety Policy
Introduction
John Hampden Grammar School (JHGS) recognises that internet, mobile and digital technologies provide
a good opportunity for children and young people to learn, provided they are used safely. The digital world
is vast and fast moving and young people’s future economic success may be partly dependent on their
online skills and reputation. We are, therefore, committed to ensuring that all students, staff, governors
and trustees will be able to use the internet, mobile and digital technologies safely. This is part of our
safeguarding responsibility. Staff are aware that some students may require additional support or
teaching, including reminders, prompts and further explanation to reinforce their knowledge and
understanding of online safety issues.
We are also committed to ensuring that all those who work with children and young people, including
their parents are informed about the ever-changing risks so that they can take an active part in the
safeguarding of children.
Responsibilities
● The Headteacher has ultimate responsibility to ensure that appropriate Digital Safety Policy and
practice is embedded and monitored in the school.
● All breaches of this policy that may have put a child at risk must also be reported to the
appropriate Head of Year, who may refer the matter to the school’s Designated Safeguarding Lead
(DSL).
● All other breaches of this policy must be reported to the Assistant Head (Digital Strategy).
Organisations that are renting space from the school and are a totally separate organisation should have
and follow their own Digital Safety Policy and acceptable use agreements. However, if the organisation
has any access to the school network and equipment then they must adhere to the school’s digital safety
procedures and acceptable use agreements.
Scope of this policy
The policy applies to:
● students
● parents
● teaching and support staff
● school governors
● peripatetic teachers/coaches, supply teachers, student teachers
● visitors
● volunteers
● voluntary, statutory or community organisations using the school's facilities
The school also works with partners and other providers to ensure that students who receive part of their
education off site or who are on a school trip or residential are safe online.
The school provides online safety information for parents, through the website, in newsletters and at
events. It is important that parents understand their key role in supporting their son(s) to behave 
3
appropriately and keep themselves safe online.
This policy, supported by its acceptable use agreements, is intended to protect the interests and safety of
the whole school community.
Policy and procedure
The school seeks to ensure that internet, mobile and digital technologies are used effectively, and for their
intended educational purpose, in ways that will not infringe legal requirements or create unnecessary risk.
The school expects everyone to use internet, mobile and digital technologies responsibly and strictly
according to the conditions set out in this policy. This policy also includes expectations on appropriate
online behaviour and use of technology outside of school for students, parents, staff, governors, and all
other visitors to the school.
Monitoring student and staff use of communications and the internet is a balance between the school’s
safeguarding and PREVENT obligations and the user’s right to privacy. Use of the internet and other
related technologies through JHGS can be traced and monitored.
1. Use of email
Staff and governors should use a school email account for all school business to ensure everyone is
protected through the traceability of communication. Under no circumstances should staff contact
students, parents or conduct any school business using a personal email address. Correspondence to
parents must always be directed through the office@jhgs.bucks.sch.uk address to allow all
communication to be logged. Initiators will be blind copied into any message sent on their behalf.
Students may only use school approved accounts on the school system and only for educational purposes.
Emails created or received as part of any school role may be subject to disclosure in response to a request
for information under the Data Protection Act 2018 or the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
Staff, governors, and students should not open emails or attachments from suspect sources and should
report their receipt to the IT Support team at the earliest possible opportunity at
helpdesk@jhgs.bucks.sch.uk.
Users must not send emails which are offensive, embarrassing or upsetting to anyone (i.e. cyberbullying).
Emails that are sent by members of the JHGS community to each other or to people outside of JHGS must
be professional in tone and content.
2. Visiting online sites and downloading
Staff must preview sites, software and apps before their use in school or before recommending them to
students. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that data-sharing or data-processing
agreements must be in place with any organisation with which the school shares personal data. Before
using any online service that requires user accounts to be created or the sharing of any personal data,
staff must consult with the school’s Business Manager or Data Protection Lead so that aspects of GDPR 
4
can be assessed and deemed compliant. If internet research is set for homework, specific sites will be
suggested that have previously been checked by the teacher. All users must observe copyright of
materials from electronic sources.
Staff must only use pre-approved systems if creating blogs, wikis or other online areas in order to
communicate with students. A range of appropriate apps are available through the G Suite menu. When
working with students searching for images should be done through Google Safe Search, Google Advanced
Search or a similar application that provides greater safety than a standard search engine.
Users must not:
● Visit internet sites, make, post, download, upload or pass on, material, remarks, proposals or
comments that contain or relate to:
o Indecent images of children actually or apparently under the age of 18 or images of child abuse
(i.e. images of children, digital or cartoons, involved in sexual activity or posed to be sexually
provocative)
o Indecent images of vulnerable people over the age of 18 (i.e. images of vulnerable people, digital
or cartoons involved in sexual activity or posed to be sexually provocative)
o Adult material that breaches the Obscene Publications Act in the UK
o Promoting discrimination of any kind in relation to the protected characteristics: gender identity
and reassignment, gender/sex, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion, sexual orientation, age
and marital status
o Promoting hatred against any individual or group from the protected characteristics above
o Promoting illegal acts including physical or sexual abuse of children or adults, violence, bomb
making, drug and alcohol abuse and software piracy
o Any material that may bring the school or any individual within it into disrepute e.g. promotion of
violence, gambling, libel and disrespect
● Reveal or publicise confidential or proprietary information
● Intentionally interfere with the normal operation of the internet connection or computer network,
including the propagation of computer viruses and attempting to access restricted user software.
● Transmit unsolicited commercial or advertising material either to other users, or to organisations
connected to other networks except where permission has been given by the school
● Use the school's hardware and software facilities for running a private business
● Intimidate, threaten or cause harm to others
● Access or interfere in any way with other users' accounts
● Use software or hardware that has been prohibited by the school
All breaches of prohibited behaviours detailed above will be investigated, where appropriate, in liaison 
5
with the police.
The school recognises that in certain planned curricular activities, access to controversial and/or offensive
online content may be beneficial for educational use. This may include topics such as FGM, radicalisation
and gender identity. In such circumstances, there is an expectation of the teacher that access is preplanned, risk assessed and recorded, and permission given by the appropriate Head of Department or
Year.
3. Storage of Images
Photographs and videos provide valuable evidence of students’ achievement and progress in a variety of
contexts and can be used to celebrate the work of the school. In line with GDPR they are used only with
the written consent of parents which is secured in the first instance on a child’s entry to the school.
Records are kept on file and consent can be changed by parents/s at any time.
Parents should note that there may be some children who are at risk and must not have their image put
online and others who do not want their image online. For these reasons parents must follow the school’s
acceptable use agreement and refrain from taking or posting online photographs of any member of the
school community, other than their own son(s).
Staff and other professionals working with students, must only use school equipment to record images of
students whether on or off site, and under no circumstances should images of students be saved on
personal devices.
4. Social media communication
The school maintains a number of social media accounts, where authoring is undertaken by staff
members. All content produced should adhere to the following points:
 Only first names are used for any boys referenced
 Comments made are in line with the ethos of the school and are grammatically correct, (including
spelling, punctuation and capital letters)
 Photo consent is checked before uploading any images
 Confidential or sensitive information should never be shared via social media
Any addition to the official school social media accounts need to be approved by SLT. Social media
accounts owned or operated by members of the school community must not indicate that they are in any
way endorsed by, affiliated to, or authorised to represent the school.
The personal social media accounts of staff should be operated at the highest level of privacy, and any
content that remains accessible should not in any way undermine or disparage the school, its staff,
governors, parents or students. Social media vetting will be used in line with safer recruitment practices
in the appointment process of new staff members.
Staff must never allow connections through personal social media to students through ‘following’ or
accepting requests to be ‘followed’ or ‘friends’ etc. In addition, it is prohibited for staff to directly
communicate with students through personal social media platforms.
6
5. Printing & Photocopiers
School printers and photocopiers should only be used to print or copy content that is for School business
– they should not be used to print or copy private content. Users who are issued with a personal
photocopier code, must not give this code to any other individuals. Care must be taken with printing and
copying personal, confidential or sensitive information. When printing to a photocopier, secure printing
must be used (i.e. authentication is required to release the print job). When printing to a printer, only a
local (i.e. nearby) device should be used, to ensure the printed materials are not misplaced or picked up
by other users. Printed or copied content that is deemed to contain personal, confidential or sensitive
information must not be left unattended on or by printers or photocopiers.
It is best practice not to print documents containing personal data where they can reasonably remain in
a digital format. Any printed data should be securely disposed of in line with GDPR requirements.
6. Use of personal mobile devices (including phones)
The school allows staff, including temporary and peripatetic staff, and visitors to use personal mobile
phones and devices only in designated areas and never in the presence of students. Designated areas are
defined as those which are primarily designated for staff only use such as staff workspaces and the staff
room. Under no circumstance does the school allow a member of staff to contact a student or parent
using a personal telephone number or messaging service. If staff personal mobiles are used to access
school email and data they must have screen/device locks enabled and in use, and be locked when not
being used.
Students in Year 7-11 inclusive are allowed to bring personal mobile devices/phones to school but must
not use them during the school day. All such devices must be switched off and out of sight during school
hours and whilst on the school site. Whilst students may wear a Smart watch, they must only be used with
Wi-Fi and network connections turned off during the school day. Under no circumstance should students
use their personal mobile devices/phones to take images of any other student or any member of staff.
Sixth Form boys are permitted to use personal mobile devices/phones, although they may only be used
in designated study areas during study periods as an aide to studying. Staff may give boys permission to
use a device in a lesson at their discretion where an educational benefit is perceived. Devices must be set
to silent.
The school is not responsible for the loss, damage or theft on school premises of any personal mobile
device.
Users bringing personal devices into school must ensure there is no inappropriate or illegal content on
the device (see also appendix G: Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices, and appendix H:
Digital Learning User Agreement for Sixth Form).
7. New technological devices
New personal technological devices may offer opportunities for teaching and learning. However, the
school must consider educational benefit and carry out risk assessment before use in school is allowed.
Parents and students should not assume that new technological devices, e.g. smart glasses, will be allowed
in school. Smart watches are not permitted in any internal or public examinations under school and JCQ
regulations respectively. From Year 9, students, with staff permission, may use a Chromebook (Yr9), iPad
(Yrs 10 and 11) or laptop. Other concessions will be made at the school’s discretion to support learning of
individual students. Further information on the use of one-to-one devices for KS3 and KS4 is provided in
the Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices (Appendix G).
7
8. Reporting incidents, abuse and inappropriate material
There may be occasions in school when either a student or an adult receives an offensive, abusive or
inappropriate message or accidentally accesses upsetting or abusive material. When such a situation
occurs the student or member of staff must report the incident immediately to the DSL, or the
Headteacher. Where such an incident may lead to significant harm, safeguarding procedures should be
followed. The school takes the reporting of such incidents seriously and where judged necessary, the DSL
will refer details to the LADO, social care, or the police.
The Curriculum
Online safety is embedded within our curriculum. The school provides a comprehensive curriculum for
online safety which enables students to become informed, safe and responsible. This includes teaching to
prevent radicalisation, for which staff provide a narrative to counter extremism. The curriculum is flexible
and can respond to any immediate online safety issues and risks as they emerge.
It is necessary for students to develop skills of critical awareness, digital resilience and good online
citizenship to enable them to use internet, mobile and digital technologies safely and responsibly.
Students are taught to recognise the creative, collaborative, cultural, economic and educational
opportunities provided by the internet, mobile and digital technologies. Curriculum work will also include:
● Understanding how to use the internet, mobile and digital technologies in a balanced and
appropriate way to avoid negative impact on wellbeing, e.g. regulated screen time and diverse
online activity
● Learning how to develop a positive online reputation and enhance future opportunities e.g. in
relationships and employment
● Developing critical thinking skills in relation to online content e.g. recognising fake news and
extremism, understanding commercial manipulation, maintaining an authentic sense of self that
is resilient to online pressure, learning how easy it is to lie online (i.e. users may not be who they
say they are and may have ulterior motives)
● Understanding the dangers of giving out personal details online (e.g. full name, address,
mobile/home phone numbers, school details, IM/email address) and the importance of
maintaining maximum privacy online
● Thinking carefully before placing images online and considering their appropriateness and
understanding the importance of gaining consent before posting photographs of others
● Understanding the permanency of all online postings and conversations
● Understanding relevant legislation, including copyright, and the importance of respecting other
people’s information, reputation and images
● What constitutes cyberbullying, how to avoid it, the impact it has and how to access help.
Staff and governor training
Staff and governors are trained to fulfil their roles in online safety. The school audits the training needs of
all school staff and provides regular training to improve their knowledge and expertise in the safe and
appropriate use of internet, mobile and digital technologies.
New staff and Governors are provided with a copy of the Digital Safety Policy and must sign the school’s
Acceptable Use Agreement as part of their induction and before having contact with students (Appendix 
8
A).
Working in partnership with families
The school works closely with families to help ensure that children can use internet, mobile and digital
technologies safely and responsibly both at home and school. It is important that parents understand the
crucial role they play in this process. The school provides regular updated online safety information
through the school website and by other means. Students and parents are required to sign the Acceptable
Use Agreement – Students & Parents (Appendix B).
Records, monitoring and review
The school recognises the need to record online safety incidents and to monitor and review policies and
procedures regularly in order to ensure they are effective and that the risks to students and staff are
minimised.
All breaches of this policy must be reported and all reported incidents will be logged. All staff have the
individual responsibility to ensure that incidents have been correctly recorded, acted upon and reported.
The school supports students and staff who have been affected by a policy breach. Where there is
inappropriate or illegal use of internet, mobile and digital technologies, this will be dealt with under the
school’s behaviour and disciplinary policies as appropriate. Breaches may also lead to criminal or civil
proceedings.

Appendix A: Digital Safety Acceptable Use Agreement – Staff and Governors
You must read this agreement in conjunction with the Digital Safety Policy. Once you have read this, you
must sign and submit this agreement and it will be kept on record in the school. You should retain your
own copy for reference. This forms part of your professional and safeguarding responsibilities.
Internet, mobile and digital technologies are part of our daily working life and this agreement is designed
to ensure that all staff and governors are aware of their responsibilities in relation to their use. All staff
and governors are expected to adhere to this agreement and to the Digital Safety Policy. Any concerns or
clarification should be discussed with the Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy). Breaches will be
investigated, recorded and, where appropriate, disciplinary procedures will apply and police involvement
will be sought.
Internet Access
I will not access or attempt to access any sites that contain any of the following: child abuse; pornography;
discrimination of any kind; promotion of prejudice against any group; promotion of illegal acts; any other
information which may be illegal or offensive. Inadvertent access on school equipment must be treated
as an online safety incident and reported to the DSL if this may constitute a safeguarding incident, or
otherwise to the Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy).
Online conduct
● I will ensure that my online activity, both in and outside school, will not bring the school, my
professional reputation, or that of others, into disrepute.

● I will not give out my personal contact and online account information such as phone numbers,
email address, and social media account details to students and/or parents.
11
Social networking
I understand the need to separate my professional role from my private friendships; in my professional
capacity I will not become ‘friends’ with parents or students on social networks. Where my school role is
my only connection to an individual, private online contact is unacceptable with parents or students.
When using social networking for personal use I will ensure my settings are not public. My private account
postings will never undermine or disparage the school, its staff, governors, parents or students. Privileged
information must remain confidential.
The school maintains a number of social media accounts, where authoring is undertaken by staff
members. All content produced should adhere to the following points:
 Only first names are used for any boys referenced
 Comments made are in line with the ethos of the school and are grammatically correct, (including
spelling, punctuation and capital letters)
 Photo consent is checked before uploading any images
 Confidential or sensitive information should never be shared via social media
Passwords
I understand that there is no occasion when a password should be shared with a student or anyone who
is not a staff member.
Data protection
I will follow requirements for data protection as outlined in the JHGS Data Protection policy. These
include:
● Photographs must be kept securely and used appropriately, whether in school, taken off-site or
accessed remotely. Photographs of students must only be used with parental and student
consent, and the list of students for whom consent has not been given must be checked.
● Personal data can only be taken out of school or accessed remotely when authorised by the
Headteacher, Deputy Headteacher or Business Manager.
● Personal or sensitive data taken off site must be encrypted or on a password protected device.
Images and videos
I will only upload images or videos of staff, students or parents onto school approved sites where specific
permission has been granted.
I will not take images, sound recordings or videos of school events or activities on any personal device or
for non-school use.
Use of email
I will use a JHGS domain email address for all school business. All such correspondence must be kept
professional and is open to Subject Access Requests under the GDPR. I will not use a JHGS email addresses
for personal matters or non-school business.
Use of personal devices
I understand that as a member of staff I should at no time put myself in a position where a safeguarding 
12
allegation can be made against me as a result of my use of personal devices. I understand that the use of
personal devices in school is at the discretion of the Headteacher.
I will only use approved personal devices in designated areas and never in front of students.
Use of personal devices at home: Personal data must not be downloaded or saved onto personal laptops
or PCs.
External Hard-drives and USB Sticks
Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that no viruses, malware or other malicious software are
uploaded from portable storage devices, and where there is any concern regarding this, the IT Helpdesk
must be notified immediately.
Additional hardware/software
I will not install any hardware or software on school equipment without permission of the Assistant
Headteacher (Digital Strategy).
Promoting online safety
I understand that online safety is the responsibility of all students, staff, and governors and I will promote
positive online safety messages at all times including when setting homework or providing pastoral
support.
I understand that it is my duty to support a whole school safeguarding approach and will report any
inappropriate or concerning behaviour (of other staff, governors, visitors, students or parents) to the DSL.
Classroom management of internet access
I will pre-check for appropriateness all internet sites use for teaching and learning; this will include the
acceptability of other material visible, however briefly, on the site. I will not free-surf the internet in front
of students.
If I am using the internet to teach about controversial issues I will secure, on every occasion, approval in
advance for the material I plan to use with an SLT line manager.
User signature
I agree to follow this Acceptable Use Agreement and to support online safety throughout the school. I
understand this forms part of the terms and conditions set out in my contract of employment (staff
members only) and/or my responsibilities as a governor.

Appendix C: Digital Safety Policy guide - Summary of key parent responsibilities
The school provides online safety information for parents, through the website, in newsletters and at
events. It is important that parents understand their key role in supporting children to behave
appropriately and keep themselves safe online.
The Digital Safety Policy, supported by its acceptable use agreements, is intended to protect the interests
and safety of the whole school community.
● Parents are required to support their child in understanding and signing the Digital Safety
Acceptable Use Agreement for students.
● Parents may only use personal mobile phones and devices in designated areas of the school unless
otherwise informed, e.g. for specific events and activities. Under no circumstance should images
be taken at any time on school premises that include anyone other than their own child, unless
there is a pre-specified agreement with individuals and parents. When a parent is on school
premises but not in a designated area, their phone/s must be switched off and out of sight.
● Parents should not assume that students can bring technological devices to school and should
always check the school policy.
● All cyberbullying incidents affecting children in the school should be reported immediately.
Incidents that occur in school or on a school platform (such as Google Classroom) should be raised
with the appropriate Head of Year. (If the incident involves an indecent image of a child the report
must also be made immediately to the police for your own protection.) The school will investigate
and respond to all reported cyberbullying incidents, liaising with others where appropriate. No
reply should ever be sent to the sender/poster of cyberbullying content. If applicable block the
sender and report abuse to the site. Evidence should be retained and shown in school and/or to
the police. Evidence should not be forwarded. For cyberbullying incidents that happen outside of
the school context please visit the following link for advice on the most appropriate actions to
take: https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/how-to-report
● The school may choose to set up social media sites, blogs or have some other online presence in
its own name. Parents, however, do not have the right to set up any site, page, chat group or any
other online presence that uses the school name or logo in any form.
● Any parent distressed or concerned about an aspect of school should make immediate contact
with a member of staff rather than posting their concerns online. Parents should not share school
related information or images online or post material that may bring the school or any individual
within it into disrepute. Negative postings about the school would impact on the reputation of
the whole school community. Parents are encouraged to report breaches so that we can protect
the reputation of the school, staff, students and parents.
Please see the full Digital Safety Policy in the policies section on the school website.
17
Appendix D: Guidance on the process for responding to cyberbullying incidents
All cyberbullying incidents should be reported and responded to. Where the perpetrator is a member of
the school community the majority of cases can be dealt with through mediation and/or disciplinary
processes. In all circumstances the school will enforce the published behaviour policy.
The following procedures are recommended:
● Never reply to the sender/poster of cyberbullying content. If applicable, block the sender.
● Incidents should be reported immediately. Students should report to a member of staff (e.g. class
teacher, Headteacher) and staff members should seek support from their line manager or a senior
member of staff.
● The person reporting the cyberbullying should save the evidence and record the time and date.
This evidence must not be forwarded but must be available to show at a meeting. Under no
circumstances should indecent images of children and young people be printed or forwarded as
this is a further criminal act. Staff should not ask to see the evidence of reported indecent images
of children or young people but must refer this immediately to the police. Any member of staff
being shown such evidence should immediately inform their line manager or the Headteacher so
that the circumstances can be recorded.
● A senior member of staff will meet with the person who has reported the incident and the target,
if different, to listen, reassure and support. All relevant facts will be reviewed and documented.
● A senior member of staff, typically the Head of Year, will conduct an investigation.
● Anyone found to have cyberbullied will have attention drawn to the seriousness of their behaviour
and if necessary the police will be involved. If the comments are threatening, abusive, sexist, of
a sexual nature, constitute a hate crime or are libellous they may well break the law. Online
harassment and stalking is also a crime.
● Once evidence has been secured then the person who has cyberbullied will be requested to
remove the offending comments/material. Any refusal will lead to an escalation of sanctions.
18
Appendix E: Guidance for staff on preventing and responding to negative comments on social media
The school should make it clear which, if any, social media platforms are used to communicate with
parents. If used correctly, parents can use a school’s social media site as a source of reliable information.
The Digital Safety Policy, see especially Appendix C (Digital Safety Policy Guide - Summary of key parent
responsibilities), clarifies that no other social media platforms should be set up using the school’s name
or logo.
The school should regularly reinforce with all parties that negative discussion of school issues on social
media platforms should not take place as this could bring the school into disrepute and affect families and
children. Parents should be encouraged to be good online role models and not post statements written
in anger or frustration. Identified routes to raise concerns directly with the school should be used.
If negative comments are posted:
● Collect the facts
As soon as you become aware of adverse comments relating to the school you need to establish what is
being said. It is essential that if you have access to the postings they are secured and retained together
with any other evidence. Do not become engaged in responding directly.
If the allegations against a member of staff or a student are of a serious nature, these will need to be
formally investigated. This may involve the police and the Headteacher will need to follow the school’s
safeguarding procedures.
If there is a risk of serious damage to the school reputation or the reputation of individual members of
staff, professional legal advice should be sought.
Adverse comments of any kind are highly demotivating and cause stress and anxiety. It is important that
the senior staff reassure and support all staff and/or other affected members of the school community.
● Addressing negative comments and complaints
Contact the complainants and invite them to a meeting. In the meeting, make sure you have any evidence
available.
The meeting must:
Draw attention to the seriousness and impact of the actions/postings;
● Ask for the offending remarks to be removed;
● Explore the complainant’s grievance;
● Agree next steps;
● Clarify the correct complaints procedures.
If the meeting does not resolve the issue, the parents must be informed that the school will need to take
the matter further. This may include: 
19
● Reporting the matter to the social network site if it breaches their rules or breaks the law;
● Reporting the matter to the police if it breaks the law, e.g. if the comments are threatening,
abusive, malicious, sexist, of a sexual nature, constitute a hate crime or are libellous they may
well break the law. Online harassment and stalking is also a crime.
If inappropriate postings continue or the original material is not removed, a second meeting is advisable
to re-iterate the seriousness of the matter.

How to Avoid Portable Device Theft
Due to size and portability, iPads Chromebooks and Laptop devices are especially vulnerable to
theft. Staff members should follow the procedures set out below. Below are some tips on how
to protect your laptop from being stolen.
1. Do not leave a device in an unlocked vehicle, even if the vehicle is in your driveway or
garage. Never leave it in plain sight. If you must leave your device in a vehicle, the best
place is in a locked boot. If you do not have a boot, cover it and lock the doors.
2. Be aware of the damage extreme temperature can cause to computers.

Appendix G: Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices (Year 7-11)
Dear Parent
This agreement is for all students in Key Stages 3 and 4 when using any device in school.
We are determined to ensure that devices are only used in lessons when there are clear educational
advantages to doing so. We want the device to become a useful tool for learning and for establishing
richer, more challenging, and engaging home-learning experiences.
We are aware of the risks associated with using new technology in this way and we have tried to provide
detailed guidelines on how we will work, with your help, to manage these risks as much as possible.
I would be grateful if you would take the time to read this document carefully, and ensure that your son
is made fully aware of the issues pertaining to the responsible and acceptable use of digital technology.
This agreement will be signed by all students and their parents before they are issued with a device, or
given permission to use their own device. Any breach of these rules will result in sanctions and it is highly
likely that the use of an in-school device will be withdrawn.
This agreement is an addendum to the Digital Safety Policy, and specifically deals with issues raised by the
use of personal devices at JHGS.
Please cut off and return the reply slip on the last page to your form tutor. You will not be permitted to
use your own device until this has been received.
Mr J Turner
Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy) 
23
General Principles
This is an addendum to the published Digital Safety Policy, which is available in full to view on the school’s
website. You should specifically refer to the ‘Digital Safety Acceptable Use Agreement – Students &
Parents’ that discusses acceptable behaviour when using digital communication devices.
● Devices are permitted in lessons to conduct learning activities that may include research,
production of content and communication with others. Please remember that access to devices
and the Internet is a privilege, not a right, and that access requires responsibility.
● Staff members have the right to look at the content stored on the device at any time and they
may review files and communications to ensure that users are using the system responsibly. Users
should not expect that files saved or produced within the school domain are confidential and
private.
● Unfortunately, as well as containing some incredible resources to support your learning, the
Internet also contains inappropriate material and behaviour. You must report (either to the police
via CEOP or to a senior teacher) anything that you feel uncomfortable about or that you think is
inappropriate. Further information can be found at https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/
● You should ensure that you do not fill the device with music, videos and games so that there is no
storage available for work.
● Any work produced must be yours – the failure to acknowledge someone else’s work either
deliberately or by mistake can constitute plagiarism which may lead to sanctions being issued.
● In the same way as hacking on the school network is a serious offence, trying to access other
peoples’ work from shared folders etc. will be treated in a similar way.
● Try to limit the amount of time that you spend using your devices. There is evidence that excessive
screen time has negative health implications. Teachers will not be using them in every lesson and
not for the whole lesson, however if you have been spending a large amount of time doing your
homework on the device then please ensure that you take regular breaks and don’t continue to
then play games after you have completed your school work.
● For Chromebook users, devices should be brought to school fully charged. If you forget your
Chromebook, you should visit the IT Department (next to room 17) before registration to borrow
a school Chromebook for the day. This must be returned at the end of the school day.
● Please ensure that your own device is locked, secured with an appropriate password and clearly
marked identifying it as yours. Avoid using any identifying stickers or markers that are not
appropriate in the school environment. If in doubt, ask.
In Lesson Use
Some teachers will use the devices in lessons more than others. This is likely to vary throughout the year
as some lessons/topics may be more suited to the use of new technology than others. The use of the
device in school is always at the teacher’s discretion. If the teacher hasn’t asked you to use the device,
then it should not be open or turned on. 
24
● The device may only be used with the permission of the member of staff.
● The device may only be used for the purpose expressed by the member of staff.
● Sounds must be muted at all times unless permission is obtained from the teacher, including the
option of using personal headphones.
● Any use of the device for playing games will result in significant sanctions and may lead to
confiscation.
● The use of any recording (video, photographs or audio) will only be done with the permission and
under the guidance of a member of staff.
● All recorded material is for your personal use only and must not be placed in the public domain
(e.g. Facebook, YouTube etc.)
● Recording another student or a member of staff without their permission will be treated
extremely seriously. This includes out of lesson time.
Use at school outside lessons
● The device must only be used in school for matters related to your lessons.
● The device must not be used in school for playing games, using social networks, entertainment
(e.g. watching a video on YouTube unrelated to your studies) or communication except by email
or one of the pre-approved apps.
● The device should only be used in school in classrooms or the LRC (not the
playground/quads/field).
● We want to encourage students to work collaboratively with their device in their own time,
however it is essential that students spend time away from the device and take a break.
● You should be aware that the use of the device is a privilege and one not afforded to some other
members of the school at present.
● All email use must be using the school account allocated.
● While email is likely to become a key means of communication between staff and students it is
important that students are aware of the rules regarding this area and do not cause offence or
add needlessly to staff workload. Wherever possible avoid using emails to staff. If you are able to
go and find that member of staff personally and speak to them directly then this is always
preferable. Any essential emails to staff, such as those sent to hand in work, should always be
politely written and with the same formal tone as writing a letter. Start the email with Sir/Ma’am
or the member of staff’s name and always end with ‘Thank you’ and your name.
Using the device at home (Chromebook users only)
▪ Students are allowed to set up wireless networks on their devices to assist them with their use
while at home.
▪ Parents are responsible for web filtering while devices are in use at home.
▪ During school, teachers will guide students toward appropriate materials, and only school
approved apps will be allowed. Outside of school, families bear responsibility for such guidance
as they must also exercise with information sources such as television, telephones, movies, radio
and other potentially offensive media.
Keeping you and the device safe
▪ You must keep the device in its protective sleeve / case at all times.
25
▪ Devices can be damaged if subjected to rough treatment and the screens are sensitive to damage
from excessive pressure, so do not put pressure on the screen.
▪ The device must be kept with you or locked away at all times (school lockers may be used).
▪ When travelling to and from school you should keep the device out of sight. This means that when
you are at a bus stop or on the bus (even if it is a private bus) it should stay in your bag. If you are
approached, hand the device over. It is insured and can be tracked (Chromebooks only).
▪ If you are not going directly home, you should leave the device locked away at school unless you
are accompanied by your parents.
▪ The device is not insured in an unattended car unless concealed in a locked boot (see the
insurance policy for more information)
▪ Devices must be clearly named and serial number stickers must be left on (Chromebook
warranties are invalidated if the serial number is removed)
Loss or damage to devices (applies to Chromebooks only from 2020 issue)
▪ If a device bought and insured through the scheme is damaged and requires repair or islost/stolen
a claim must be made to the insurance company. Parents will be given details on how to make a
claim.
▪ If a device is lost or stolen the police must be informed.
▪ Parents may be asked to pay further sums towards the cost of replacement or repair if this user
agreement has not been followed.
Breaches of this code will be taken seriously and may result in the device being confiscated for a period
of time. If a person violates any of the User Terms and Conditions named in this policy, privileges may be
terminated, access to the technology resources may be denied, and the appropriate disciplinary action
shall be applied. Violations may result in disciplinary action up to and including exclusion for students.
When applicable, the police may be involved.

Digital Safety Policy
Introduction
John Hampden Grammar School (JHGS) recognises that internet, mobile and digital technologies provide
a good opportunity for children and young people to learn, provided they are used safely. The digital world
is vast and fast moving and young people’s future economic success may be partly dependent on their
online skills and reputation. We are, therefore, committed to ensuring that all students, staff, governors
and trustees will be able to use the internet, mobile and digital technologies safely. This is part of our
safeguarding responsibility. Staff are aware that some students may require additional support or
teaching, including reminders, prompts and further explanation to reinforce their knowledge and
understanding of online safety issues.
We are also committed to ensuring that all those who work with children and young people, including
their parents are informed about the ever-changing risks so that they can take an active part in the
safeguarding of children.
Responsibilities
● The Headteacher has ultimate responsibility to ensure that appropriate Digital Safety Policy and
practice is embedded and monitored in the school.
● All breaches of this policy that may have put a child at risk must also be reported to the
appropriate Head of Year, who may refer the matter to the school’s Designated Safeguarding Lead
(DSL).
● All other breaches of this policy must be reported to the Assistant Head (Digital Strategy).
Organisations that are renting space from the school and are a totally separate organisation should have
and follow their own Digital Safety Policy and acceptable use agreements. However, if the organisation
has any access to the school network and equipment then they must adhere to the school’s digital safety
procedures and acceptable use agreements.
Scope of this policy
The policy applies to:
● students
● parents
● teaching and support staff
● school governors
● peripatetic teachers/coaches, supply teachers, student teachers
● visitors
● volunteers
● voluntary, statutory or community organisations using the school's facilities
The school also works with partners and other providers to ensure that students who receive part of their
education off site or who are on a school trip or residential are safe online.
The school provides online safety information for parents, through the website, in newsletters and at
events. It is important that parents understand their key role in supporting their son(s) to behave 
3
appropriately and keep themselves safe online.
This policy, supported by its acceptable use agreements, is intended to protect the interests and safety of
the whole school community.
Policy and procedure
The school seeks to ensure that internet, mobile and digital technologies are used effectively, and for their
intended educational purpose, in ways that will not infringe legal requirements or create unnecessary risk.
The school expects everyone to use internet, mobile and digital technologies responsibly and strictly
according to the conditions set out in this policy. This policy also includes expectations on appropriate
online behaviour and use of technology outside of school for students, parents, staff, governors, and all
other visitors to the school.
Monitoring student and staff use of communications and the internet is a balance between the school’s
safeguarding and PREVENT obligations and the user’s right to privacy. Use of the internet and other
related technologies through JHGS can be traced and monitored.
1. Use of email
Staff and governors should use a school email account for all school business to ensure everyone is
protected through the traceability of communication. Under no circumstances should staff contact
students, parents or conduct any school business using a personal email address. Correspondence to
parents must always be directed through the office@jhgs.bucks.sch.uk address to allow all
communication to be logged. Initiators will be blind copied into any message sent on their behalf.
Students may only use school approved accounts on the school system and only for educational purposes.
Emails created or received as part of any school role may be subject to disclosure in response to a request
for information under the Data Protection Act 2018 or the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
Staff, governors, and students should not open emails or attachments from suspect sources and should
report their receipt to the IT Support team at the earliest possible opportunity at
helpdesk@jhgs.bucks.sch.uk.
Users must not send emails which are offensive, embarrassing or upsetting to anyone (i.e. cyberbullying).
Emails that are sent by members of the JHGS community to each other or to people outside of JHGS must
be professional in tone and content.
2. Visiting online sites and downloading
Staff must preview sites, software and apps before their use in school or before recommending them to
students. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that data-sharing or data-processing
agreements must be in place with any organisation with which the school shares personal data. Before
using any online service that requires user accounts to be created or the sharing of any personal data,
staff must consult with the school’s Business Manager or Data Protection Lead so that aspects of GDPR 
4
can be assessed and deemed compliant. If internet research is set for homework, specific sites will be
suggested that have previously been checked by the teacher. All users must observe copyright of
materials from electronic sources.
Staff must only use pre-approved systems if creating blogs, wikis or other online areas in order to
communicate with students. A range of appropriate apps are available through the G Suite menu. When
working with students searching for images should be done through Google Safe Search, Google Advanced
Search or a similar application that provides greater safety than a standard search engine.
Users must not:
● Visit internet sites, make, post, download, upload or pass on, material, remarks, proposals or
comments that contain or relate to:
o Indecent images of children actually or apparently under the age of 18 or images of child abuse
(i.e. images of children, digital or cartoons, involved in sexual activity or posed to be sexually
provocative)
o Indecent images of vulnerable people over the age of 18 (i.e. images of vulnerable people, digital
or cartoons involved in sexual activity or posed to be sexually provocative)

All breaches of prohibited behaviours detailed above will be investigated, where appropriate, in liaison 
5
with the police.
The school recognises that in certain planned curricular activities, access to controversial and/or offensive
online content may be beneficial for educational use. This may include topics such as FGM, radicalisation
and gender identity. In such circumstances, there is an expectation of the teacher that access is preplanned, risk assessed and recorded, and permission given by the appropriate Head of Department or
Year.
3. Storage of Images
Photographs and videos provide valuable evidence of students’ achievement and progress in a variety of
contexts and can be used to celebrate the work of the school. In line with GDPR they are used only with
the written consent of parents which is secured in the first instance on a child’s entry to the school.
Records are kept on file and consent can be changed by parents/s at any time.
Parents should note that there may be some children who are at risk and must not have their image put
online and others who do not want their image online. For these reasons parents must follow the school’s
acceptable use agreement and refrain from taking or posting online photographs of any member of the
school community, other than their own son(s).
Staff and other professionals working with students, must only use school equipment to record images of
students whether on or off site, and under no circumstances should images of students be saved on
personal devices.
4. Social media communication
The school maintains a number of social media accounts, where authoring is undertaken by staff
members. All content produced should adhere to the following points:
 Only first names are used for any boys referenced
 Comments made are in line with the ethos of the school and are grammatically correct, (including
spelling, punctuation and capital letters)
 Photo consent is checked before uploading any images
 Confidential or sensitive information should never be shared via social media
Any addition to the official school social media accounts need to be approved by SLT. Social media
accounts owned or operated by members of the school community must not indicate that they are in any
way endorsed by, affiliated to, or authorised to represent the school.
The personal social media accounts of staff should be operated at the highest level of privacy, and any
content that remains accessible should not in any way undermine or disparage the school, its staff,
governors, parents or students. Social media vetting will be used in line with safer recruitment practices
in the appointment process of new staff members.
Staff must never allow connections through personal social media to students through ‘following’ or
accepting requests to be ‘followed’ or ‘friends’ etc. In addition, it is prohibited for staff to directly
communicate with students through personal social media platforms.
6
5. Printing & Photocopiers
School printers and photocopiers should only be used to print or copy content that is for School business
– they should not be used to print or copy private content. Users who are issued with a personal
photocopier code, must not give this code to any other individuals. Care must be taken with printing and
copying personal, confidential or sensitive information. When printing to a photocopier, secure printing
must be used (i.e. authentication is required to release the print job). When printing to a printer, only a
local (i.e. nearby) device should be used, to ensure the printed materials are not misplaced or picked up
by other users. Printed or copied content that is deemed to contain personal, confidential or sensitive
information must not be left unattended on or by printers or photocopiers.
It is best practice not to print documents containing personal data where they can reasonably remain in
a digital format. Any printed data should be securely disposed of in line with GDPR requirements.
6. Use of personal mobile devices (including phones)
The school allows staff, including temporary and peripatetic staff, and visitors to use personal mobile
phones and devices only in designated areas and never in the presence of students. Designated areas are
defined as those which are primarily designated for staff only use such as staff workspaces and the staff
room. Under no circumstance does the school allow a member of staff to contact a student or parent
using a personal telephone number or messaging service. If staff personal mobiles are used to access
school email and data they must have screen/device locks enabled and in use, and be locked when not
being used.
Students in Year 7-11 inclusive are allowed to bring personal mobile devices/phones to school but must
not use them during the school day. All such devices must be switched off and out of sight during school
hours and whilst on the school site. Whilst students may wear a Smart watch, they must only be used with
Wi-Fi and network connections turned off during the school day. Under no circumstance should students
use their personal mobile devices/phones to take images of any other student or any member of staff.
Sixth Form boys are permitted to use personal mobile devices/phones, although they may only be used
in designated study areas during study periods as an aide to studying. Staff may give boys permission to
use a device in a lesson at their discretion where an educational benefit is perceived. Devices must be set
to silent.
The school is not responsible for the loss, damage or theft on school premises of any personal mobile
device.
Users bringing personal devices into school must ensure there is no inappropriate or illegal content on
the device (see also appendix G: Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices, and appendix H:
Digital Learning User Agreement for Sixth Form).
7. New technological devices
New personal technological devices may offer opportunities for teaching and learning. However, the
school must consider educational benefit and carry out risk assessment before use in school is allowed.
Parents and students should not assume that new technological devices, e.g. smart glasses, will be allowed
in school. Smart watches are not permitted in any internal or public examinations under school and JCQ
regulations respectively. From Year 9, students, with staff permission, may use a Chromebook (Yr9), iPad
(Yrs 10 and 11) or laptop. Other concessions will be made at the school’s discretion to support learning of
individual students. Further information on the use of one-to-one devices for KS3 and KS4 is provided in
the Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices (Appendix G).
7
8. Reporting incidents, abuse and inappropriate material
There may be occasions in school when either a student or an adult receives an offensive, abusive or
inappropriate message or accidentally accesses upsetting or abusive material. When such a situation
occurs the student or member of staff must report the incident immediately to the DSL, or the
Headteacher. Where such an incident may lead to significant harm, safeguarding procedures should be
followed. The school takes the reporting of such incidents seriously and where judged necessary, the DSL
will refer details to the LADO, social care, or the police.
The Curriculum
Online safety is embedded within our curriculum. The school provides a comprehensive curriculum for
online safety which enables students to become informed, safe and responsible. This includes teaching to
prevent radicalisation, for which staff provide a narrative to counter extremism. The curriculum is flexible
and can respond to any immediate online safety issues and risks as they emerge.
It is necessary for students to develop skills of critical awareness, digital resilience and good online
citizenship to enable them to use internet, mobile and digital technologies safely and responsibly.
Students are taught to recognise the creative, collaborative, cultural, economic and educational
opportunities provided by the internet, mobile and digital technologies. Curriculum work will also include:
● Understanding how to use the internet, mobile and digital technologies in a balanced and
appropriate way to avoid negative impact on wellbeing, e.g. regulated screen time and diverse
online activity
● Learning how to develop a positive online reputation and enhance future opportunities e.g. in
relationships and employment
● Developing critical thinking skills in relation to online content e.g. recognising fake news and
extremism, understanding commercial manipulation, maintaining an authentic sense of self that
is resilient to online pressure, learning how easy it is to lie online (i.e. users may not be who they
say they are and may have ulterior motives)
● Understanding the dangers of giving out personal details online (e.g. full name, address,
mobile/home phone numbers, school details, IM/email address) and the importance of
maintaining maximum privacy online
● Thinking carefully before placing images online and considering their appropriateness and
understanding the importance of gaining consent before posting photographs of others
● Understanding the permanency of all online postings and conversations
● Understanding relevant legislation, including copyright, and the importance of respecting other
people’s information, reputation and images
● What constitutes cyberbullying, how to avoid it, the impact it has and how to access help.
Staff and governor training
Staff and governors are trained to fulfil their roles in online safety. The school audits the training needs of
all school staff and provides regular training to improve their knowledge and expertise in the safe and
appropriate use of internet, mobile and digital technologies.
New staff and Governors are provided with a copy of the Digital Safety Policy and must sign the school’s
Acceptable Use Agreement as part of their induction and before having contact with students (Appendix 
8
A).
Working in partnership with families
The school works closely with families to help ensure that children can use internet, mobile and digital
technologies safely and responsibly both at home and school. It is important that parents understand the
crucial role they play in this process. The school provides regular updated online safety information
through the school website and by other means. Students and parents are required to sign the Acceptable
Use Agreement – Students & Parents (Appendix B).
Records, monitoring and review
The school recognises the need to record online safety incidents and to monitor and review policies and
procedures regularly in order to ensure they are effective and that the risks to students and staff are
minimised.
All breaches of this policy must be reported and all reported incidents will be logged. All staff have the
individual responsibility to ensure that incidents have been correctly recorded, acted upon and reported.
The school supports students and staff who have been affected by a policy breach. Where there is
inappropriate or illegal use of internet, mobile and digital technologies, this will be dealt with under the
school’s behaviour and disciplinary policies as appropriate. Breaches may also lead to criminal or civil
proceedings.

Appendix A: Digital Safety Acceptable Use Agreement – Staff and Governors
You must read this agreement in conjunction with the Digital Safety Policy. Once you have read this, you
must sign and submit this agreement and it will be kept on record in the school. You should retain your
own copy for reference. This forms part of your professional and safeguarding responsibilities.
Internet, mobile and digital technologies are part of our daily working life and this agreement is designed
to ensure that all staff and governors are aware of their responsibilities in relation to their use. All staff
and governors are expected to adhere to this agreement and to the Digital Safety Policy. Any concerns or
clarification should be discussed with the Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy). Breaches will be
investigated, recorded and, where appropriate, disciplinary procedures will apply and police involvement
will be sought.
Internet Access
I will not access or attempt to access any sites that contain any of the following: child abuse; pornography;
discrimination of any kind; promotion of prejudice against any group; promotion of illegal acts; any other
information which may be illegal or offensive. Inadvertent access on school equipment must be treated
as an online safety incident and reported to the DSL if this may constitute a safeguarding incident, or
otherwise to the Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy).
Online conduct
● I will ensure that my online activity, both in and outside school, will not bring the school, my
professional reputation, or that of others, into disrepute.

● I will not give out my personal contact and online account information such as phone numbers,
email address, and social media account details to students and/or parents.
11
Social networking
I understand the need to separate my professional role from my private friendships; in my professional
capacity I will not become ‘friends’ with parents or students on social networks. Where my school role is
my only connection to an individual, private online contact is unacceptable with parents or students.
When using social networking for personal use I will ensure my settings are not public. My private account
postings will never undermine or disparage the school, its staff, governors, parents or students. Privileged
information must remain confidential.
The school maintains a number of social media accounts, where authoring is undertaken by staff
members. All content produced should adhere to the following points:
 Only first names are used for any boys referenced
 Comments made are in line with the ethos of the school and are grammatically correct, (including
spelling, punctuation and capital letters)
 Photo consent is checked before uploading any images
 Confidential or sensitive information should never be shared via social media
Passwords
I understand that there is no occasion when a password should be shared with a student or anyone who
is not a staff member.
Data protection
I will follow requirements for data protection as outlined in the JHGS Data Protection policy. These
include:
● Photographs must be kept securely and used appropriately, whether in school, taken off-site or
accessed remotely. Photographs of students must only be used with parental and student
consent, and the list of students for whom consent has not been given must be checked.
● Personal data can only be taken out of school or accessed remotely when authorised by the
Headteacher, Deputy Headteacher or Business Manager.
● Personal or sensitive data taken off site must be encrypted or on a password protected device.
Images and videos
I will only upload images or videos of staff, students or parents onto school approved sites where specific
permission has been granted.
I will not take images, sound recordings or videos of school events or activities on any personal device or
for non-school use.
Use of email
I will use a JHGS domain email address for all school business. All such correspondence must be kept
professional and is open to Subject Access Requests under the GDPR. I will not use a JHGS email addresses
for personal matters or non-school business.
Use of personal devices
I understand that as a member of staff I should at no time put myself in a position where a safeguarding 
12
allegation can be made against me as a result of my use of personal devices. I understand that the use of
personal devices in school is at the discretion of the Headteacher.
I will only use approved personal devices in designated areas and never in front of students.
Use of personal devices at home: Personal data must not be downloaded or saved onto personal laptops
or PCs.
External Hard-drives and USB Sticks
Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that no viruses, malware or other malicious software are
uploaded from portable storage devices, and where there is any concern regarding this, the IT Helpdesk
must be notified immediately.
Additional hardware/software
I will not install any hardware or software on school equipment without permission of the Assistant
Headteacher (Digital Strategy).
Promoting online safety
I understand that online safety is the responsibility of all students, staff, and governors and I will promote
positive online safety messages at all times including when setting homework or providing pastoral
support.
I understand that it is my duty to support a whole school safeguarding approach and will report any
inappropriate or concerning behaviour (of other staff, governors, visitors, students or parents) to the DSL.
Classroom management of internet access
I will pre-check for appropriateness all internet sites use for teaching and learning; this will include the
acceptability of other material visible, however briefly, on the site. I will not free-surf the internet in front
of students.
If I am using the internet to teach about controversial issues I will secure, on every occasion, approval in
advance for the material I plan to use with an SLT line manager.
User signature
I agree to follow this Acceptable Use Agreement and to support online safety throughout the school. I
understand this forms part of the terms and conditions set out in my contract of employment (staff
members only) and/or my responsibilities as a governor.

Appendix B: Digital Safety Acceptable Use Agreement – Students & Parents [continued…]
Dear Parent,
The internet, email, mobile technologies and online resources have become an important part of learning

aware of online risk, know how to stay safe and know where to go to report problems and access support.
Pupils are expected to read and discuss this agreement with you and then sign below to show they will
follow the terms of the agreement. Any concerns or explanation can be discussed with Mr Turner -
Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy).
Please can you also sign and return the parent agreement below.
This document will be kept on record at the school.

Appendix C: Digital Safety Policy guide - Summary of key parent responsibilities
The school provides online safety information for parents, through the website, in newsletters and at
events. It is important that parents understand their key role in supporting children to behave
appropriately and keep themselves safe online.
The Digital Safety Policy, supported by its acceptable use agreements, is intended to protect the interests
and safety of the whole school community.
● Parents are required to support their child in understanding and signing the Digital Safety
Acceptable Use Agreement for students.
● Parents may only use personal mobile phones and devices in designated areas of the school unless
otherwise informed, e.g. for specific events and activities. Under no circumstance should images
be taken at any time on school premises that include anyone other than their own child, unless
there is a pre-specified agreement with individuals and parents. When a parent is on school
premises but not in a designated area, their phone/s must be switched off and out of sight.
● Parents should not assume that students can bring technological devices to school and should
always check the school policy.
● All cyberbullying incidents affecting children in the school should be reported immediately.
Incidents that occur in school or on a school platform (such as Google Classroom) should be raised
with the appropriate Head of Year. (If the incident involves an indecent image of a child the report
must also be made immediately to the police for your own protection.) The school will investigate
and respond to all reported cyberbullying incidents, liaising with others where appropriate. No
reply should ever be sent to the sender/poster of cyberbullying content. If applicable block the
sender and report abuse to the site. Evidence should be retained and shown in school and/or to
the police. Evidence should not be forwarded. For cyberbullying incidents that happen outside of
the school context please visit the following link for advice on the most appropriate actions to
take: https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/how-to-report
● The school may choose to set up social media sites, blogs or have some other online presence in
its own name. Parents, however, do not have the right to set up any site, page, chat group or any
other online presence that uses the school name or logo in any form.
● Any parent distressed or concerned about an aspect of school should make immediate contact
with a member of staff rather than posting their concerns online. Parents should not share school
related information or images online or post material that may bring the school or any individual
within it into disrepute. Negative postings about the school would impact on the reputation of
the whole school community. Parents are encouraged to report breaches so that we can protect
the reputation of the school, staff, students and parents.
Please see the full Digital Safety Policy in the policies section on the school website.
17
Appendix D: Guidance on the process for responding to cyberbullying incidents
All cyberbullying incidents should be reported and responded to. Where the perpetrator is a member of
the school community the majority of cases can be dealt with through mediation and/or disciplinary
processes. In all circumstances the school will enforce the published behaviour policy.
The following procedures are recommended:
● Never reply to the sender/poster of cyberbullying content. If applicable, block the sender.
● Incidents should be reported immediately. Students should report to a member of staff (e.g. class
teacher, Headteacher) and staff members should seek support from their line manager or a senior
member of staff.
● The person reporting the cyberbullying should save the evidence and record the time and date.
This evidence must not be forwarded but must be available to show at a meeting. Under no
circumstances should indecent images of children and young people be printed or forwarded as
this is a further criminal act. Staff should not ask to see the evidence of reported indecent images
of children or young people but must refer this immediately to the police. Any member of staff
being shown such evidence should immediately inform their line manager or the Headteacher so
that the circumstances can be recorded.
● A senior member of staff will meet with the person who has reported the incident and the target,
if different, to listen, reassure and support. All relevant facts will be reviewed and documented.
● A senior member of staff, typically the Head of Year, will conduct an investigation.
● Anyone found to have cyberbullied will have attention drawn to the seriousness of their behaviour
and if necessary the police will be involved. If the comments are threatening, abusive, sexist, of
a sexual nature, constitute a hate crime or are libellous they may well break the law. Online
harassment and stalking is also a crime.
● Once evidence has been secured then the person who has cyberbullied will be requested to
remove the offending comments/material. Any refusal will lead to an escalation of sanctions.
18
Appendix E: Guidance for staff on preventing and responding to negative comments on social media
The school should make it clear which, if any, social media platforms are used to communicate with
parents. If used correctly, parents can use a school’s social media site as a source of reliable information.
The Digital Safety Policy, see especially Appendix C (Digital Safety Policy Guide - Summary of key parent
responsibilities), clarifies that no other social media platforms should be set up using the school’s name
or logo.
The school should regularly reinforce with all parties that negative discussion of school issues on social
media platforms should not take place as this could bring the school into disrepute and affect families and
children. Parents should be encouraged to be good online role models and not post statements written
in anger or frustration. Identified routes to raise concerns directly with the school should be used.
If negative comments are posted:
● Collect the facts
As soon as you become aware of adverse comments relating to the school you need to establish what is
being said. It is essential that if you have access to the postings they are secured and retained together
with any other evidence. Do not become engaged in responding directly.
If the allegations against a member of staff or a student are of a serious nature, these will need to be
formally investigated. This may involve the police and the Headteacher will need to follow the school’s
safeguarding procedures.
If there is a risk of serious damage to the school reputation or the reputation of individual members of
staff, professional legal advice should be sought.
Adverse comments of any kind are highly demotivating and cause stress and anxiety. It is important that
the senior staff reassure and support all staff and/or other affected members of the school community.
● Addressing negative comments and complaints
Contact the complainants and invite them to a meeting. In the meeting, make sure you have any evidence
available.
The meeting must:
Draw attention to the seriousness and impact of the actions/postings;
● Ask for the offending remarks to be removed;
● Explore the complainant’s grievance;
● Agree next steps;
● Clarify the correct complaints procedures.
If the meeting does not resolve the issue, the parents must be informed that the school will need to take
the matter further. This may include: 
19
● Reporting the matter to the social network site if it breaches their rules or breaks the law;
● Reporting the matter to the police if it breaks the law, e.g. if the comments are threatening,
abusive, malicious, sexist, of a sexual nature, constitute a hate crime or are libellous they may
well break the law. Online harassment and stalking is also a crime.
If inappropriate postings continue or the original material is not removed, a second meeting is advisable
to re-iterate the seriousness of the matter.

Appendix F: School Issued Technology Agreement
This agreement is an appendix of the school Digital Safety Policy, and is for staff who have been issued
with a school device to facilitate the effective and efficient undertaking of school related business. The
agreement applies to the use of school issued devices both on and off the school premises. Any device
issued to you remains the property of John Hampden Grammar School, and is provided to you while you
remain employed at this school.
In accepting responsibility of the issued device, staff members must comply and agree with the following:
● Staff members should NOT attempt to install software or hardware or change the system
configuration including network settings without prior consultation with the ICT department.
● Staff members will provide access to any laptop computer, equipment, and/or accessories they
have been assigned upon the school’s request.
● Only software licensed by the school, authorised by the school and installed by the school’s ICT
staff may be used.
● Should any faults occur the school’s ICT staff must be advised as soon as possible so that they may
undertake any necessary repairs, or issue a replacement. Under no circumstances should staff
attempt to fix suspected hardware faults. All faults should be reported to the ICT department
● Any charges incurred by staff accessing the Internet from home are not chargeable to the school.
● School policies regarding appropriate use, data protection, computer misuse and health and
safety must be adhered to by all users of the laptop.
● Protective sleeves or bags should be used when transporting devices to minimise the risk of
damage, and as an insurance requirement for Chromebooks.
How to Avoid Portable Device Theft
Due to size and portability, iPads Chromebooks and Laptop devices are especially vulnerable to
theft. Staff members should follow the procedures set out below. Below are some tips on how
to protect your laptop from being stolen.
1. Do not leave a device in an unlocked vehicle, even if the vehicle is in your driveway or
garage. Never leave it in plain sight. If you must leave your device in a vehicle, the best
place is in a locked boot. If you do not have a boot, cover it and lock the doors.
2. Be aware of the damage extreme temperature can cause to computers.

Appendix G: Digital Learning User Agreement for Personal Devices (Year 7-11)
Dear Parent
This agreement is for all students in Key Stages 3 and 4 when using any device in school.
We are determined to ensure that devices are only used in lessons when there are clear educational
advantages to doing so. We want the device to become a useful tool for learning and for establishing
richer, more challenging, and engaging home-learning experiences.
We are aware of the risks associated with using new technology in this way and we have tried to provide
detailed guidelines on how we will work, with your help, to manage these risks as much as possible.
I would be grateful if you would take the time to read this document carefully, and ensure that your son
is made fully aware of the issues pertaining to the responsible and acceptable use of digital technology.
This agreement will be signed by all students and their parents before they are issued with a device, or
given permission to use their own device. Any breach of these rules will result in sanctions and it is highly
likely that the use of an in-school device will be withdrawn.
This agreement is an addendum to the Digital Safety Policy, and specifically deals with issues raised by the
use of personal devices at JHGS.
Please cut off and return the reply slip on the last page to your form tutor. You will not be permitted to
use your own device until this has been received.
Mr J Turner
Assistant Headteacher (Digital Strategy)

General Principles
This is an addendum to the published Digital Safety Policy, which is available in full to view on the school’s
website. You should specifically refer to the ‘Digital Safety Acceptable Use Agreement – Students &
Parents’ that discusses acceptable behaviour when using digital communication devices.
● Devices are permitted in lessons to conduct learning activities that may include research,
production of content and communication with others. Please remember that access to devices
and the Internet is a privilege, not a right, and that access requires responsibility.
● Staff members have the right to look at the content stored on the device at any time and they
may review files and communications to ensure that users are using the system responsibly. Users
should not expect that files saved or produced within the school domain are confidential and
private.
● Unfortunately, as well as containing some incredible resources to support your learning, the
Internet also contains inappropriate material and behaviour. You must report (either to the police
via CEOP or to a senior teacher) anything that you feel uncomfortable about or that you think is
inappropriate. Further information can be found at https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/
● You should ensure that you do not fill the device with music, videos and games so that there is no
storage available for work.
● Any work produced must be yours – the failure to acknowledge someone else’s work either
deliberately or by mistake can constitute plagiarism which may lead to sanctions being issued.
● In the same way as hacking on the school network is a serious offence, trying to access other
peoples’ work from shared folders etc. will be treated in a similar way.
● Try to limit the amount of time that you spend using your devices. There is evidence that excessive
screen time has negative health implications. Teachers will not be using them in every lesson and
not for the whole lesson, however if you have been spending a large amount of time doing your
homework on the device then please ensure that you take regular breaks and don’t continue to
then play games after you have completed your school work.
● For Chromebook users, devices should be brought to school fully charged. If you forget your
Chromebook, you should visit the IT Department (next to room 17) before registration to borrow
a school Chromebook for the day. This must be returned at the end of the school day.
● Please ensure that your own device is locked, secured with an appropriate password and clearly
marked identifying it as yours. Avoid using any identifying stickers or markers that are not
appropriate in the school environment. If in doubt, ask.
In Lesson Use
Some teachers will use the devices in lessons more than others. This is likely to vary throughout the year
as some lessons/topics may be more suited to the use of new technology than others. The use of the
device in school is always at the teacher’s discretion. If the teacher hasn’t asked you to use the device,
then it should not be open or turned on. 
24
● The device may only be used with the permission of the member of staff.
● The device may only be used for the purpose expressed by the member of staff.
● Sounds must be muted at all times unless permission is obtained from the teacher, including the
option of using personal headphones.
● Any use of the device for playing games will result in significant sanctions and may lead to
confiscation.
● The use of any recording (video, photographs or audio) will only be done with the permission and
under the guidance of a member of staff.
● All recorded material is for your personal use only and must not be placed in the public domain
(e.g. Facebook, YouTube etc.)
● Recording another student or a member of staff without their permission will be treated
extremely seriously. This includes out of lesson time.
Use at school outside lessons
● The device must only be used in school for matters related to your lessons.
● The device must not be used in school for playing games, using social networks, entertainment
(e.g. watching a video on YouTube unrelated to your studies) or communication except by email
or one of the pre-approved apps.
● The device should only be used in school in classrooms or the LRC (not the
playground/quads/field).
● We want to encourage students to work collaboratively with their device in their own time,
however it is essential that students spend time away from the device and take a break.
● You should be aware that the use of the device is a privilege and one not afforded to some other
members of the school at present.
● All email use must be using the school account allocated.
● While email is likely to become a key means of communication between staff and students it is
important that students are aware of the rules regarding this area and do not cause offence or
add needlessly to staff workload. Wherever possible avoid using emails to staff. If you are able to
go and find that member of staff personally and speak to them directly then this is always
preferable. Any essential emails to staff, such as those sent to hand in work, should always be
politely written and with the same formal tone as writing a letter. Start the email with Sir/Ma’am
or the member of staff’s name and always end with ‘Thank you’ and your name.
Using the device at home (Chromebook users only)
▪ Students are allowed to set up wireless networks on their devices to assist them with their use
while at home.
▪ Parents are responsible for web filtering while devices are in use at home.
▪ During school, teachers will guide students toward appropriate materials, and only school
approved apps will be allowed. Outside of school, families bear responsibility for such guidance
as they must also exercise with information sources such as television, telephones, movies, radio
and other potentially offensive media.
Keeping you and the device safe
▪ You must keep the device in its protective sleeve / case at all times.
25
▪ Devices can be damaged if subjected to rough treatment and the screens are sensitive to damage
from excessive pressure, so do not put pressure on the screen.
▪ The device must be kept with you or locked away at all times (school lockers may be used).
▪ When travelling to and from school you should keep the device out of sight. This means that when
you are at a bus stop or on the bus (even if it is a private bus) it should stay in your bag. If you are
approached, hand the device over. It is insured and can be tracked (Chromebooks only).
▪ If you are not going directly home, you should leave the device locked away at school unless you
are accompanied by your parents.
▪ The device is not insured in an unattended car unless concealed in a locked boot (see the
insurance policy for more information)
▪ Devices must be clearly named and serial number stickers must be left on (Chromebook
warranties are invalidated if the serial number is removed)
Loss or damage to devices (applies to Chromebooks only from 2020 issue)
▪ If a device bought and insured through the scheme is damaged and requires repair or islost/stolen
a claim must be made to the insurance company. Parents will be given details on how to make a
claim.
▪ If a device is lost or stolen the police must be informed.
▪ Parents may be asked to pay further sums towards the cost of replacement or repair if this user
agreement has not been followed.
Breaches of this code will be taken seriously and may result in the device being confiscated for a period
of time. If a person violates any of the User Terms and Conditions named in this policy, privileges may be
terminated, access to the technology resources may be denied, and the appropriate disciplinary action
shall be applied. Violations may result in disciplinary action up to and including exclusion for students.
When applicable, the police may be involved.

Appendix H: Digital Learning User Agreement for Sixth Form
Dear Sixth Former
