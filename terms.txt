Option 2: Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ______ days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. 

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] 

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. 

The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name of state]. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. 

Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions. 

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than _____ years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.


Option 3: Binding Arbitration
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute" and collectively, “Disputes”), any Dispute brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. 

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. 

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] 

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. 

Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County, [name of state]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of, personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. 

Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site or Services be commenced more than ______ years after the cause of action arose. 

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Option 2/Option 3: Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Option 2/Option 3: Exceptions to [Informal Negotiations and] Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning [informal negotiations and] binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. 

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

This website uses Google services. Therefore, you also agree to the Google terms and conditions, as follows:

GOOGLE T ERMS OF SERVICE
Effective March 31, 2020
Archived versions
What’s covered in these terms
We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s
important to establish what you can expect from us as you use
Google services, and what we expect from you.
These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company,
and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define
Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the
following topic headings:
What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you
find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to
expect in case someone violates these terms
Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.
Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we
encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your
information.
Service provider
Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:
Google LLC
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, California 94043
USA
Age requirements
If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or
legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read
these terms with you.
If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms
apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific
additional terms and policies.
Your relationship with Google
These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. Broadly speaking, we give you
permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s
business works and how we earn money. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean
Google LLC and its affiliates.
What you can expect from us
Provide a broad range of useful services
We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
platforms (like Google Play)
integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
devices (like Google Home)
Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the
next. For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google
Calendar.
Improve Google services
We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we
invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and
to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations. As part of this continual
improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits
to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.
We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we
carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact
on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve
performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical
developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to
offer.
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a
service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content
from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing
abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.
What we expect from you
Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms
The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities
in:
these terms
service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age
requirements
We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common
questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy
Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.
Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we
have in the services.
Respect others
Many of our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment
for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for
example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services
Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate
conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these
rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a
fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.
Permission to use your content
Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your
content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the
content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you
have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.
License
Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that
you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative
content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone
else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.
We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.
You provide Google with that permission through this license.
What’s covered
This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.
What’s not covered
This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual
property rights
This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the
address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s
considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is
covered in the Service-related communications section below.
Scope
This license is:
worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
Rights
This license allows Google to:
host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save
your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to
others
modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
sublicense these rights to:
other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share
photos with people you choose
our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these
terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below
Purpose
This license is for the limited purpose of:
operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as
designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated
systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
for spam, malware, and illegal content
to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album
in Google Photos to keep related photos together
to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and
personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off
in Ads Settings)
This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote
a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might
show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms
Duration
This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.
If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems
will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two
exceptions:
If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you
shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that
photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it
from your Google Account.
If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that
search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as
part of their search results.
Using Google services
Your Google Account
If you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some
services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you
need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.
You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to
keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.
Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
Many organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services.
To use our services on behalf of an organization:
an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might
require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.
If you’re based in the United Kingdom, then these terms don’t affect the rights you may have as a
business user of online intermediation services — including online platforms such as Google Play —
under the EU Platform-to-Business Regulation.
Service-related communications
To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other
information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.
If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your
feedback without obligation to you.
Content in Google services
Your content
Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example,
you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that
you created.
See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and
how your content is used in our services
See the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated
content from our services
If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the
infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google
Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.
Google content
Some of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual
illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and
any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in
our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to
use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.
Other content
Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or
organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper
article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s
permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’
content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.
Software in Google services
Some of our services include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software
as part of the services.
The license we give you is:
worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license
personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else
Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make
available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override
parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may
not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written
permission or applicable law lets you do so.
When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates
automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust
your automatic update settings.
In case of problems or disagreements
By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go
wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a consumer,
then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.
Warranty
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in
this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.
Disclaimers
The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the
specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1)
described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided
under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.
Liabilities
For all users
These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms
don’t limit Google’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct.
Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or
disagreements), Google won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our
breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.
For business users and organizations only
If you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:
You’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any thirdparty legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to
your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional
terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
indirect or consequential loss
punitive damages
Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) £500
or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the
breach
If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those
responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain
immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
Taking action in case of problems
Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably
possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we
reasonably believe that doing so would:
cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
compromise an investigation
compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services
Removing your content
If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific
additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or
Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with
applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or
harassment, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.
Suspending or terminating your access to Google services
Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google
Account if any of these things happen:
you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies
we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
— for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping
content that doesn’t belong to you
If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.
Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service,
we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.
Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.
If you’re a resident of, or an organization based in, the United Kingdom, these terms and your
relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by
English law, and you can file legal disputes in the English courts.
About these terms
By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These
terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for
other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.
We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But
not all services mentioned may be available in your country.
If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right
away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the
future.
We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our
services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies,
pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent
abuse or harm.
If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with
reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a
